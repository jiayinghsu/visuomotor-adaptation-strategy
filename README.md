## Introduction 
How do we filter through the noisy information in the environment to dynamically choose the most important spatial location? The human capacity of adapting to variations in the environment by learning novel mappings between sensory feedback and motor control serves as the foundation for successful motor performances. The feedback control in the motor system would compensate for the errors within movements induced by external factors. The predictive control in the motor system then processes information about the errors to inform future movements (Taylor, 2007). This sensorimotor learning process is typically composed of two distinct mechanisms: an error-based implicit component and a strategy-dependent explicit component (Desmurget et al., 2001; Lehéricy et al., 2005; Galea et al., 2010). Past research examined mainly the role of attention in evaluating errors in motor learning. However, they have not focused on the contribution of attention to the explicit and implicit components of motor adaptation. 

## Method
To study this, I designed a dual-task paradigm that combines **motion tacking** and **eye tracking** equipments to examine the moment-to-moment role of attention during adaption and how attention affects the explicit and implicit components of learning. This paradigm consists of a movement task and a discrimination task that help differentiate and expose attention’s role in the explicit and implicit processes of motor control. Participants are divided into three groups, and each group has a different movement task. The first group reaches directly to the target without rotation. The second group has a 30-degree abrupt rotation while the third group has a 30-degree gradual rotation. I hypothesize that brain regions from the attention network will show stronger connectivity with motor regions associated with movement target location during the early stage of implicit motor learning. Such connectivity will decrease as attention will slowly drift to the hand movement location at the later stage of learning.

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![Stimulus sequence](https://github.com/jiayinghsu/visuomotor_adaptation_strategy/blob/main/stimulus_sequence.png)  | Eight mask elements (composed of irregular shape) were presented on a uniform black background and arranged on an imaginary circle. Participants were instructed to direct their right or left hands and their gaze to the central fixation cross before each trial. To begin each trial, the participant moved his or her hand into a starting position, indicated by a 1-cm circle. When the side was more than 1 cm away from the center of the start location, a ring was presented, with the diameter equal to the distance from the center of the start circle. Moving toward the center reduced the radius of this circle. As the participant’s hand positioned at the center, the central cross changed into an arrow that pointed toward any one of the eight mask stimuli around 580 ms after fixation. Participants reached to the cued location while maintaining central fixation. Visual feedback about reaching accuracy was given 1500 ms later.
